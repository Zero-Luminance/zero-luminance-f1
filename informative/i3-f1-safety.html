                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p class="subhead">
                        It is without a doubt since the inception of Formula 1 in July 13th, 1950, the sport, or the entire genre of 
                        motorsport rather, will continue to carry an element of danger regardless of the safety measures implemented. 
                        As of the date this article was uploaded, a total of 52 Formula 1 driver fatalities<sup><a href="#reference-1">(1)</a></sup> 
                        have been recorded. The most recent being Jules Bianchi<sup><a href="#reference-2">(2)</a></sup>, who succumbed to his 
                        injuries in July 17th, 2015 as a result from his lethal crash in the 2014 Japanese Grand Prix. It were these 
                        deaths in Formula 1 that gradually built the safety standards the governing body of the sport, the FIA, uphold 
                        today. The consequence of these safety endeavours permits Formula 1 to be considered a relatively safe sport as 
                        of the modern era.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This article will explore the basic Formula 1 safety measures & technologies engineered & used today.

                    <h2>Barriers & Offroad Surfaces</h2>
                    <p class="subhead">
                        With any fast moving vehicle involved in a crash, it is not the speed that will kill you, but the sudden stop. 
                        G-Force<sup><a href="#reference-3">(3)</a></sup> is a unit of acceleration & is used to measure F1 crashes. Higher g-force 
                        crashes are a result of an F1 car going from a high to zero velocity within a very short amount of time. This 
                        results in the energy between the colliding bodies being distributed less equally & being more focused on the 
                        area of impact. A certain collision may have the F1 driver receiving the brunt of this injury which in turn 
                        engenders injury or a fatality.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The goal of the different types of F1 barriers & off-road surfaces is to reduce the vehicle’s speed before the 
                        crash & to ensure the collision itself occurs longer to allow the kinetic energy to be evenly distributed across 
                        the body-work of the car & barrier instead of the driver.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Types of barriers used in the modern era involve concrete walls, rail guards, tyre barriers & Techpro barriers. 
                        Each barrier is used in different sections within a track as safety engineers must account for factors such as 
                        the angle a car expected to crash & the fastest speed the car is expected travel during a certain part of the 
                        race circuit. Concrete walls & rail guards are best used in sections where cars are travelling in relatively 
                        straight lines at high speeds. Tyre & Techpro barriers are used in corners  & typically combined in areas with a 
                        lot of run-off. The video below does justice in scientifically explaining barrier technology:

                        limited to gravel, grass or asphalt. Gravel serves as the most superior option to slow a car down but as F1 cars 
                        are flat & close to the ground, once they are caught in gravel they stay stuck in gravel & thus eliminated from the 
                        race. Grass serves as more of a middle ground of all the the run-off surfaces in that they do indeed slow a car 
                        down but is far less likely to trap & car & allow it to rejoin the race track. Asphalt are a rougher versions 
                        of road surfaces intended to not necessarily slow the car down but to allow the driver the ability to steer the car 
                        out of danger at the expense of being forced to follow a long escape road to rejoin the track to prevent 
                        corner-cutting.

                    <p class="subhead">
                        Historically, Formula 1 & motorsport in general would waive safety basic requirements such as seat belts. In the 
                        early days of F1, it was header simply consisted of a cloth caps & goggles. Fortunately crash helmets were 
                        mandatory in 1952 <span class="bold">(2 years after the sports founding)</span> but were more akin to baseball 
                        helmets that lacked full face & ballistic protection modern helmets must provide.

                    <p>
                        The first full face helmet was used in 1968 by Dan Gurney in the United States Indianapolis 
                        GP<sup><a href="#reference-5">(5)</a></sup>. Subsequent decades would focus on designing F1 fireproof helmets & equipment by 
                        using nomex<sup><a href="#reference-6">(6)</a></sup> to account for the highly flammable nature of the 1960s-1990s F1 cars. 
                        After the aforementioned years, the modern era<sup><a href="#reference-7">(7)</a></sup> focuses on helmet ballistics protection 
                        as seen through the use of layers of hardshell, kevlar & padding.

                        <span class="bold">'HANS'</span> stands for <span class="bold">'Head And Neck Support'</span> that takes a similar 
                        shape as a neck pillow is attached to the driver's helmet in order to prevent lethal & violent head movement in the event
                        of a crash. Invented by biomedical engineering professor Dr Robert Hubbard, the HANS device was made mandatory in 
                        Formula 1 in 2003 & is used in a most FIA sancationed motorsports. Several drivers in motorsport died as a result of
                        basilar skull fractures arising from head movement in crashes which could have been prevented by the HANS device.

                        Fireproofing, together with ballistics remains one of the most important aspects of Formula 1 driver safety. One only 
                        needs to look at the injuries sustained by 3-time world champion & one of F1’s all time great, Nikki Lauda, at the 
                        1976 German GP hosted on Nordschleife track. The champion crashed & suffered from severe skin burns, damaged lungs & 
                        blood as a result of the smoke & inferno<sup><a href="#reference-8">(8)</a></sup>.

                        another vehicle or barrier. The importance of the HALO would become evident due to historical incidents such as Filipe 
                        Massa being hit by a sprint from the Brawn F1 car he was trailing in 2009 & the incident between Charles Leclerc & Fernando

                        The safety cars are mainly used to regulate the speeds of F1 cars in the event of an incident that involves debris or

                        car must adhere to a low speed limit to provide safe track conditions for marshals to clear the track of hazardous obstructions. 
                        Marshals also perform duties such as such as waving race flags, reporting incidents to race control, etc.
