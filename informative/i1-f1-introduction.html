                        Formula One <span class="bold">(F1)</span> is a single-seater open wheel international racing championship 
                        regulated by the <span class="bold">Fédération Internationale de l’Automobile (FIA</span>) & is considered 
                        the pinnacle of motorsport. <span class="bold">‘Formula’</span> refers to the FIA created rules which all 
                        participants must adhere to & <span class="bold">'One'</span> indicates the sport being the highest tier of racing.

                    <p>
                        The sport may accommodate a maximum of 13 teams <span class="bold">(a.k.a Constructors)</span> of which, 
                        employ 2 drivers who are super license qualified; as of the 2022 FIA Formula 1 World 
                        Championship<sup><a href="#reference-1">(1)</a></sup> there exists 10 teams & thus 20 drivers.

                        A Formula 1 Championship consists of Grand Prix <span class="bold">(i.e. races)</span> hosted globally on a track/circuit; F1 has 
                        historically conducted between 7-22 grand prix a year. Each Grand Prix presents the opportunity for teams & 
                        drivers to score points which contribute to their standings in the championship.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The F1 Championship consists of 2 categories: the Constructors & Drivers Championship. The Constructor’s 
                        <span class="bold">(or Team)</span> Championship consists of the points accrued by BOTH the team’s drivers over 
                        race weekends. The Driver’s Championship stacks drivers against each other individually regardless of team. 
                        Obviously, the team or driver with the most points wins the respective championship.

                    <h2>The Appeal Of Formula 1 Cars & Drivers:</h2>

                    <p class="subhead">
                        What separates F1 cars from any other is its ability to create a large volume of aerodynamic downforce & thus 
                        be capable of blisteringly fast cornering speeds. These machines are no easy feat to operate too as a large 
                        number of driver aids found in many cars such as automatic shifting, traction control, active suspension, etc.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The consequence of driving F1 cars quickly through corners is the G-Force exerted on their body. G-Forces peak 
                        at around 6.5 lateral g <span class="bold">(6 times the F1 driver’s body weight)</span>. Drivers experience 
                        such forces any instance they turn, accelerate or decelerate. When combining how hot the driver’s 
                        cockpit can be <span class="bold">(usually at least 44C)</span><sup><a href="#reference-2">(2)</a></sup> 
                        & the forces are they endure, a total of 2 - 4.5kg<sup><a href="#reference-3">(3)</a></sup> of weight is lost 
                        per race (2 hours). F1 drivers do not just turn & touch the throttle or break peddles, they are athletes.
                    </p>

                    </figure>

                    <p>
                        To clarify the amount of money poured into these cars, Ferrari back in 2018 spent $512.69 million (usd) on 
                        research & development<sup><a href="#reference-4">(4)</a></sup> & still LOST to Mercedes AMG in both the 
                        constructors & drivers championship with three races left to spare. Hundreds of millions of dollars are spent 
                        mainly on a car’s aerodynamic body, engine, breaks, etc all to have a competitive edge amounting to hundredths 
                        or thousandths in lap time. Losing hundredths of a second per lap may seem insignificant to the ordinary 
                        person, but hundredths may add up to several seconds over the course of a race which is considered an 
                        eternity in Formula 1.

                    <h2>An International Circus:</h2>

                    <p class="subhead">
                        As a global sport, Formula 1 conducts it’s Grand Prix on FIA-graded race circuits around the world. Each country 
                        typically holds accommodates 1 Grand Prix, e.g. Italian in Monza, Australian Grand Prix in Albert Park, etc. 
                        Historically the 1950-60s would accommodate 11 Grand Prix yearly, with the 1970s-2000s holding 14-17 races. Ever 
                        since Liberty Media bought the Formula 1 brand in late 2016, races in 2021 & 2022 have reached a record high of 
                        22 yearly.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Each Grand Prix <span class="bold">(GP)</span> circuit has defining characteristics which in turn challenges 
                        engineers & drivers in different ways. The Singaporean GP was the first ever night race in F1, one of few true-street 
                        circuits & is known for its hot & humid weather easily making it the circuit that driver’s lose the most amount of 
                        weight due to excessive sweating. The Mexican GP circuit has the highest geographical altitude from sea level; the 
                        air is more thin which in turn forces engineers to account for the decrease in downforce a car will have to command. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Thus for people with the travel-bug, Formula 1 serves as the ultimate excuse to go & see different countries. 
                        As even after the race weekend ends there exists a life outside the hectic motorsport circus. There is culture, food & 
                        venues travellers will be able to experience.
