                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p class="subhead">
                        Formula 1 <span class="bold">‘Race Weekends’</span> as the name implies is the week of a Grand Prix is 
                        held. It is generally held once every two weeks from March to November, but the schedule may permit a 
                        maximum of 3 back-to-back weekends. Each weekend is either held under the 
                        <span class="bold">‘Traditional’</span> or <span class="bold">'Sprint’</span> format (more on this later). 
                        Regardless of the race format, every weekend at the very least contains 
                        <span class="bold">(starting from Friday)</span> a couple days allocated for Free Practice, Qualifying, 
                        & finally the Grand Prix.

                    <h2>Free Practice</h2>
                    <p class="subhead">
                        Each race weekend begins with 3 Free Practice <span class="bold">(FP1, FP2 & FP3)</span> sessions for the 
                        Traditional format & 2 Free Practice <span class="bold">(FP1 & FP3)</span> sessions for the Sprint format. 
                        <span class="bold">‘Free Practice’</span> is intended for teams & drivers to not just acclimatise to a new 
                        race track but to engineer & try different set up items <span class="bold">(e.g. combinations between 
                            downforce, camber tyre camber, fuel loads, etc)</span> or implement a new aerodynamic or power 
                            unitupgrade. Each free practice session is 90 minutes long. FP1 & FP2 are held on Friday during the 
                            morning & afternoon respectively. FP3 is held during Saturday hours before the qualifying. After each 
                            free practice session every driver is ranked according to the fastest lap they posted throughout 
                            the session.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The general consensus is that it is preferred for viewers to skip such sessions as the final rankings 
                        typically does not represent true performance during the qualifying or the race.

                    <h2>Qualifying</h2>
                    <p class="subhead">
                        <span class="bold">‘Qualifying’</span> determines the order in which the drivers line up during the start of 
                        the Grand Prix <span class="bold">(a.k.a grid position)</span>. Each driver does a single lap of the GP 
                        circuit & the faster their lap time, the closer one is placed in the front of the order. Qualifying is held on 
                        Saturday after FP3, lasts 1 hour & consists of 3 separate elimination rounds being Q1, Q2 & Q3 with a short 
                        break in between. Typically between each qualifying session, every driver has the opportunity to attempt two 
                        laps for their fastest lap time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span class="bold">'Q1'</span> has all 20 drivers on the circuit. The drivers posting the 5 slowest lap times 
                        are eliminated from future Q2 & Q3 sessions where they are allocated P16-20 slots on the grid.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span class="bold">'Q2'</span> has 16 drivers on the circuit. Similar to Q1 the drivers with the 5 slowest lap 
                        times are eliminated. The grid positions from P11-15 are allocated here. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span class="bold">'Q3'</span> determines the top 10 drivers on the grid. The driver that establishes the 
                        fastest lap time in this session is awarded ‘Pole Position’ & is due to start the race at the front. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Each car uses a <span class="bold">‘tyre compound’</span> which as of 2019 consists of Softs 
                        <span class="bold">(Red)</span>, Mediums <span class="bold">(Yellow)</span>, & Hards <span class="bold">(White)</span>. 
                        Rain tyres consist of Intermediates <span class="bold">(Green)</span> for light rain or a damp track, Full Wets 
                        <span class="bold">(Blue)</span> for a heavy duty rain or wet surfaces. Softer tyres allows helps cars perform 
                        faster lap times but have a shorter lifespan compared to hard tyres. 
                    </p>

                        <figcaption>All the F1 tyre compounds</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>
                        Note that the tyre compound used by drivers that made it to Q3 is the tyre they will begin for the race, 
                        whereas drivers eliminated in Q1 or Q2 have a <span class="bold">‘Free Choice’</span> in switching their tyres 
                        before the race. This is important as there are some instances where it is strategically better to start P11 or 
                        P12 with a more suitable tyre than start P9 or P10 with a faster but short lived tyre.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the Sprint Format, all drivers are required to use soft tyres. Subsequently, the Sprint Race permits all to 
                        change to a different tyre compound.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Qualifying can be very important as for the 
                        <a href="https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/video.monaco-gp-punctured-leclerc-limps-back-to-pits-after-touching-wall.6060937219001.html" 
                        target="blank">Monaco GP for example</a>, the track is so narrow that it is rare drivers will overtake each 
                        during the race.

                    <h2>Grand Prix</h2>
                    <p class="subhead">
                        The <span class="bold">‘Grand Prix’</span> or <span class="bold">‘Race Day’</span> is where ALL the championship 
                        points are earned in the Traditional format & MOST for the Sprint Format. The winner of a GP must cross the finish 
                        line having completed a set number of laps, with anyone after must complete 90% of a race distance to qualify for 
                        a finish. As each race circuit covers different 1-lap distances <span class="bold">(e.g. 3.337km for Monaco GP & 
                        7.003km for Belgium GP)</span>, the number of laps required to be completed must sum to a total of 305km of distance 
                        covered. The only aforementioned rule to this is the Monaco GP which must only complete 250km to ensure the GP lasts 
                        less than 2 hours.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Before the race, drivers complete a formation. A 5-light system above the track queues the drives when they can 
                        start the race. During the race any conflicts between teams/drivers are resolved by the Stewards 
                        <span class="bold">(referees)</span> & a set of safety protocols are carried out by safety cars & coloured flags 
                        to manage incidents such as crashes, car failures, etc. Throughout the race drivers must complete at least 1 
                        pitstop.    
                    </p>
