## Description:
This project is a Formula 1 fan & commentator's website where I upload informative & opinion articles. [Formula 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One) is the highest class of single-seater motorsport where teams compete for the FIA Formula 1 Constructors & Drivers Championships. Using this website I also intend to engage with fans & followers & direct them to my social media accounts where we can discuss about the sport.

## Purpose & Technologies:
This website serves as my first public project in software development & is aimed to provide an environment where I can continally come back to so as to implement new web development skills or technologies I have learned. Technologies currently used include:
- HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)
- CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)

## Features:
- Webpages: Home, About, Informative, Opinion & Credits
- Links to social media
- Responsive design

## Limitations:
- [ ] The addition or modification of content is very manual:
    - Text from article drafts must be directly & structured to a HTML file
    - Images used in articles & _'Credits'_ must be manually on their respective HTML document
- [ ] Website will benefit from _'Search'_ & _'Filter'_ features to query specifc articles to reduce user scrolling
- [ ] Lacks SEO when querying on Google, Firefox, Safari, etc.

## Bugs:
- [ ] Navigation bar stops becoming visible after scrolling down a certain amount
- [ ] CSS queries need to be refactored to remove redundancies & bad practices
- [ ] Homepage hero image fails to appear when viewing in 'Desktop site' on mobile devices 

## Future Plans:
Overtime I intend to acquire the skillset of a full-stack software engineer. This will entail me to learn technologies such as Javascript, NodeJS, a relational or cloud database such as SQL or MongoDB. These aforementioned skills will allow be to turn this static website into a fully dynamic CRUD web application. When this is possible work will be done on a separate git branch that will undergo testing before being made the _'main'_ branch.

This README.md will also be updated in the future to include animations for ease-of-use purposes such as 'feature' showcases of the website, 'installation' shorts, etc.

## Project Installation & Use:
Due to the costs associated with running a wesbite this project is currently intended to run locally.
