## Description:
[Formula 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One) is the highest class of single-seater motorsport where teams compete for the FIA Formula 1 Constructors & Drivers Championships. 

This project is a Formula 1 fan website capable of uploading opinion & informative articles about the sport. Although ***incomplete***, the final product of this website should be able to allow users to inferface with the website via comments for each article, & the ability to sign up for notifications.

## Purpose & Technologies:
This website serves as my ***first public project*** in software development & is aimed to provide an environment where I can continally come back to & implement new web development skills or technologies I have learned. Technologies currently used include:
- HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)
- CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)

## Features:
- Webpages: Home, About, Informative, Opinion & Credits
- Links to social media

## Limitations:
- The addition or modification of content is very manual:
    - Text from article drafts must be directly & structured to a HTML file
    - Images used in articles & ***'Credits'*** must be manually on their respective HTML document
- Website will benefit from ***'Search'*** & ***'Filter'*** features to query specifc articles to reduce user scrolling
- Lacks SEO when querying on Google, Firefox, Safari, etc.
- Each article could use a ***'Comments'*** section where readers can give input
- Should include a ***'Sign Up'*** feature where users can recieve updates

## Bugs:
- Navigation bar stops becoming visible after scrolling down a certain amount
- CSS queries need to be refactored to remove redundancies & bad practices
- Homepage hero image fails to appear when viewing in ***'Desktop site'*** on mobile devices 

## Future Plans:
Overtime I intend to acquire the skillset of a full-stack software engineer. This will entail me to learn technologies such as Javascript, NodeJS, a relational or cloud database such as SQL or MongoDB. These aforementioned skills will allow be to turn this static website into a fully dynamic CRUD web application. When this is possible work will be done on a separate git branch that will undergo testing before being made the ***'main'*** branch.

This README.md will also be updated in the future to include _animations_ for ease-of-use purposes such as 'feature' showcases of the website, 'installation' shorts, etc.

## Project Installation & Use:
Due to the costs associated with running a wesbite this project is currently intended to run locally.
1) On this project's main page on GitHub (see [here](https://github.com/Zero-Luminance/Zero-Luminance.github.io/tree/main)) click on the green button titled ***'Code'***
2) Download this project as a zip file OR clone this repository using the provided HTTPS link
3) Open your web browser of choice & enter the project's file path in the search box
