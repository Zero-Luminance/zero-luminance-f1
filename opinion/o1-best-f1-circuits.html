                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p class="subhead">
                        The teams in Formula 1 make up half of the identity of the sport, the other half consists of the 
                        Formula 1 season’s circuit calendar. Each track on the Formula 1 calendar has different characteristics 
                        such as long or short straights, altitude, weather, etc. It is each of these characteristics that 
                        exposes the strengths & weaknesses of the cars custom made by F1 teams. Taking the 2019 F1 season for 
                        example, Ferrari’s power unit was so formidable that they excelled in tracks where straight lines were 
                        prevalent such as Bahrain’s International Circuit, while Mercedes & Red Bull produced cars more suited 
                        to mid to low downforce tracks such as Hungary’s Hungaroring or Monaco’s Monte Carlo. This article 
                        explores my top 5 favourite Formula 1 tracks.

                    <h2>5 - Sepang International Circuit (Malaysian Grand Prix)</h2>
                    <p class="subhead">
                        Residing in Selangor Malaysia, the Sepang International Circuit was opened on March 7th 1999 & was 
                        architected by German engineer Hermann Tilke. Although no longer on the Formula 1 calendar, the venue
                        previously hosted the Malaysian Grand Pri between 1999 & 2017. The track has a lap distance of 
                        <span class="bold">5.543km</span>, traditionally raced clockwise & is characterised by the abundance 
                        of medium to high speed corners, unusually long straights along the starting area & after turn 15.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The track design is an anti-thesis of the Singaporean GP street circuit, but shares similar 
                        temperatures & humidity. Unlike Singapore however, Sepang is known for it’s variable weather 
                        conditions; if it rains in Sepang then it will pour. The variable weather is so concerning that F1 
                        teams refuse to solely rely on weather forecasting software & deploy spotters across different points 
                        of the track to relay real-time information about the weather.

                        Conversely, when it is not raining the weather is scorching. Before the race, drivers drink up to 
                        <span class="bold">8 litres of water</span> to account of weather in the mid 30C degrees & <span class="bold">
                        cockpit temperatures reaching 50C</span> degrees. One of my other most memorable Malaysian GP moments 
                        occurred in the 2016 season where 7-time world champion was leading the race but retired due to an a 
                        loss of oil pressure. It was this moment that arguably cost Lewis Hamilton the 2016 champion to fellow 
                        Mercedes driver & sole rival Nico Rosberg.

                    <p class="subhead">
                        Famously known as <span class="bold">“The Temple of Speed”</span> the Monza Circuit is one of the most 
                        iconic Formula 1 tracks alongside Monte Carlo in Monaco. Opened on the 3rd of September 1922, the Monza 
                        Circuit consists of 3 tracks with the main “Grand Prix” track being 5.793km long. Out of all tracks to 
                        have ever made the Formula 1 calendar, Monza has hosted the most Grand Prix of them all by participating 
                        <span class="bold">every year</span> since the sport’s inauguration in 1950 with the exception of 1980 
                        season.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        What makes the Italian GP iconic, especially when hosted in Monza is the sea of 
                        <span class="bold">Ferrari Tifosi</span> clustered in every grandstand/viewer area. These fans are the 
                        most patriotic, the team <span class="bold">“Ferrari”</span> is not just another team such as McLaren or 
                        Mercedes, but it represents Italy as whole. This is completely justified by the fact that Ferrari has 
                        existed since the sport’s existence & participated in every Formula 1 season, making them the most iconic 
                        & historical team in Formula 1 history. Simply put, Formula 1 as a brand is completely synonymous with 
                        the Ferrari brand as a season without Ferrari would not be Formula 1 at all.

                    <p>
                        Monza is a <span class="bold">“power”</span> circuit where drivers reach the highest average top speed of 
                        all tracks which fittingly reflects the Ferrari-Tifosi motif of power & passion. The abundance of high speed 
                        corners requires teams to utilise a low-downforce setup which in turn maximises top speed but makes corning 
                        more tricky & understeer likely. In the mid-2000s Formula 1 cars were capable of reaching a 
                        <span class="bold">top speed of 372km/h</span> & 2020 saw Formula 1’s most fastest car ever made with the 
                        Mercedes-AMG F1 W11 EQ Performance driver by 7-time world champion Lewis Hamilton, clock the fastest ever 
                        qualifying lap time in Monza with a 1:18.887 & <span class="bold">highest ever speed average of 362.0km/h</span>.

                    <p class="subhead">
                        Located in the Brazilian city of São Paulo, <span class="bold">Autódromo José Carlos Pace</span> better known as 
                        <span class="bold">Interlagos</span> is a 4.309km motorsport circuit & started hosting the Brazilian GP since 1973 
                        but opened in 1940. Although this track is not as old as the other circuits mentioned within this list with the 
                        exception of Sepang, Interlagos has served on multiple occasions, a title deciding track in the modern (years 2000 
                        onwards) Formula 1 Championship era. Regardless of the championship standings, Interlagos almost always provides 
                        an entertaining spectacle for viewers regardless of dry or wet conditions.

                        Interlagos is one of few non-oval racing circuits where drivers go in an <span class="bold">anti-clockwise</span> 
                        direction. Unlike Sepang & Monza, Interlagos multi-elevation track where where drivers climb and descend hills thus 
                        demanding more power from the cars engines. The anti-clockwise nature of the circuit forces drivers to factor in 
                        their fitness to adjust to F-forces pushing the driver’s neck right instead of left like a majority of the circuits 
                        on the F1 calendar.

                        Notably, Interlagos being a Brazilian track, has a notable amount of patriotic Brazilians whom cherish their national 
                        F1 drivers with arguable G.O.A.T <span class="bold">Aryton Senna</span> being the most notable, Rubens Barrichello, 
                        Filipe Massa etc. When combining the crowd’s vibe & the fact that the Interlagos is one of the final few races on the 
                        calendar, the race weekend provides some nail biting action. Moments such as the 2007 season where Kimi Raikkonen won 
                        the championship by one point between rivals Lewis Hamilton & Fernando Alonso, only to be followed by the 2008 season 
                        where Lewis Hamilton is first championship by one point against Felipe Massa, despite the latter winning the racing.

                        several redesigns ever since. The reputation Spa is built upon arises from the speed drivers reach which is also

                        after coming of a tight first-corner right-hander where they reach Eau Rouge, then move up the hill in Raidillon at 
                        flat-out speeds of 300km/h. There also exists ‘Pouhon’, a downhill left-handed corner of the track where drivers 
                        reached speeds of 289km\h in 2017.
                    </p>

                        As epic as Spa is it has proven to be a dangerous race track mentioned before. 3 time world champion 
                        <span class="bold">Sir Jackie Stewart</span> almost died in the old circuit configuration’s Masta kink. This in 
                        turn pushed Stewart to advocate for higher safety standards which consequently has made motorsport as whole a 
                        relatively safe sport. Despite this however there exists modern incidents such as the death of Antoine Hubert in the 
                        2019 Formula 2 feeder series. Other incidents include Sarah Moore & Abbie Eaton in the W Series, along with Kevin 
                        Magnussen during his 2016 Formula 1 Belgian Grand Prix. It is these incidents that put into perspective how daring 
                        race drivers are & how this sport is not one that anyone can readily participate in.

                    <p class="subhead">
                        The <span class="bold">‘Suzuka International Racing Course'</span>, best known as the 
                        <span class="bold">‘Suzuka Circuit’</span> was designed by Dutch race track designer John Hugenholtz & is a 5.807km 
                        motorsport track in Suzuka City, Mie Prefecture, Japan. Suzuka Circuit has hosted the Formula 1 Japanese Grand Prix 
                        from 1987-2006, 2009-2019 & currently set to be hosted in 2022. The track was initially held as a one of the final 
                        races on the F1 season calendar, with the first 4 years of the circuit’s introduction to the calendar serving a title 
                        decider as evident by the rivalry between all-time-greats 3-time world champion Aryton Senna & 4-time world champion 
                        Alain Prost. The circuit is more recently held between the mid-to-late F1 season.

                    <p>
                        Originally designed as a Honda test track, the circuit has become a favourite favourite amongst F1 drivers due to the 
                        overall <span class="bold">‘flow’</span> of the circuit, the unique high speed corners & being one of two FIA graded 
                        <span class="bold">“figure-eight”</span> track layouts. Upon entering turn 1 drivers can reach a speed of up to 
                        <span class="bold">330km\h</span> then decelerating to <span class="bold">170km\h</span> to deal the the double 
                        right-hand turn. Drivers then head towards the chicanes from turns 3-7, a.k.a the <span class="bold">’S’ curves</span>, 
                        never reaching a speed lower than <span class="bold">190km/h</span> whilst also physically enduring the consecutive 
                        lateral G-forces coming from the left & right sides. After going through turn 9 they head under an overpass to and 
                        decelerate to <span class="bold">70km/h</span> for the hairpin of turn 11 for moment of respite. From turns 11-16 the 
                        full power of the car's engine is brought to bear, where the car reaches speeds of up to 
                        <span class="bold">310km/h</span> 3 times between turns 11-13, 14-15, & 15-16. This circuit is best described as 
                        monster’s roller coaster where the margin for error is almost non-existent due to the lack of runoff areas.

                    <p>
                        The circuit has hosted some of the most legendary & iconic moments in F1, namely the 
                        <span class="bold">fiercest rivalry</span> between <span class="bold">Senna & Prost</span> during their days McLaren 
                        teammates between 1988-1989 & as McLaren-Ferrari competitors in 1990. In the 1989 & 1990 champion Suzuka served as a 
                        <span class="bold">championship title deciding race</span> where Senna & Prost were involved in 
                        <span class="bold">crashes</span> between each other. My favourite was the 2005 Suzuka Grand Prix, where the McLaren 
                        driver Kimi Raikkonen <span class="bold">started last place at P17</span>, & went on to <span class="bold">win</span>
                         the Grand Prix & get <span class="bold">fastest lap</span>; an extremely rare feat in Formula 1. The 2005 Suzuka GP 
                         saw gusty overtakes as evident by the moves Kimi pulled against Ferrari driver & 7 time world champion Micheal 
                         Schumacher, & then latter with the Renault of Giancarlo Fisichella.

                        Finally one cannot forget to mention the heart-warming Japanese crowd. Typically, fans spectating Grand Prix are very 
                        one sided as to who they support. The Japanese F1 fans however, could be the most fair & impartial bunch of them all 
                        as evident by the diverse array of teams & drivers they cheer in support of.
